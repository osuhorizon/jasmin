# jasmin, a blazing fast implementation of the RealistikPanel in node!
The modern admin panel for osu! private servers!

![Dashboard](https://x.catboy.best/nGVJO30.png)

It uses libraries such as express for web and is designed to interface with the Ripple stack (mainly with SQL and Redis).

# About

I'm trying to re-code every feature that the RealistikPanel currently has into javascript.

**I'm doing this project to learn some frontend and give people a chance of more maintainability*

This project is now in work to be deployed as a full replacement to RAP.

# Feature set
